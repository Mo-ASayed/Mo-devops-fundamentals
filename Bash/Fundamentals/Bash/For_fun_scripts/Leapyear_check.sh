# What does each part do?

# - The leap year check uses both arithmetic expansion ($((...))) and logical operators.
#   A leap year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless it's also divisible by 400.
# - The number range check uses the `-ge` (greater than or equal to) and `-le` (less than or equal to) operators
#   to verify that the number falls within the specified range.
